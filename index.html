                <h1>Meet the Paytient Card.</h1>
                <p class="p2">Sponsor Paytient cards for your group alongside your health plan, HSA/FSA, and other
                    health benefits to ensure your people always have a way to pay their out-of-pocket costs.</p>
                <p class="p3">Once a member uses their card to pay for care, they’ll select a personalized repayment
                    plan that turns their bill into a series of smaller payments over time — always without interest or
                    fees.</p>

       <h1>Insurers</h1>
       <p>Members receive a Paytient card with their health plan that empowers them to pay out of pocket medical expenses as well as dental and vision care. In a crowded market, Paytient helps insurers differentiate their offering to attract and retain more members.</p>

        <h1>Health Systems</h1>
        <p>Health systems can subsidize the cost of the Paytient card for local employers who want to offer it to their teams. Employees can use the card to get care with the health system's facilities and physician groups, which helps attract more commercially-insured patients.</p>
